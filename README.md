When statements are presented in the court during the trials,the witness is summoned to confirm the statement
as a legitimate statement given by them.Ideally,the witness should be physically present in the court during
trials but that is not often the case.Many factors such as distance,traffic,trial timing and date prevent the witness
from being present in the court.To overcome this,the government has allowed video conferencing to connect
with the witness during trials.The existing system is that the witness goes to NIC(National Informatics Centre)
present at the collector office in every district and connects through video call with the court.The judge then
examines the witness and takes handwritten notes.However,the issue is that NIC is used by all the departments
of the district and there are very few video call lines and the number of witness is more,so the procedure gets
delayed.
To solve this problem, we are proposing a system which will overcome these problems by enabling video calls
between witness and court where witness can video call from a legal place.This video conversation will get
stored in the local machine (laptop) in the court along with a voice-to-text file which will be helpful as a
collaborative evidence.This work will be done by the application which can also be used for connecting with
expert witness, witness in hospital or prisoners in jail.
